          <li>Besides not being physically strong or tall, Tostão was one of best players of the history of Cruzeiro
            Esporte Clube and Brazil's National Team.</li>
          <li>He started his career in América Mineiro, playing 26 matches and scoring 16 goals.</li>
          <li>In Cruzeiro, he played for 11 seasons and is still remembered in these days as one of the team's best
            players ever. He was in the notorious Taça Brasil win, against Pelé's Santos.</li>
          <li>His last team was Vasco da Gama.</li>
          <li>Due to an retina injury, Tostão retired early in his career - with only 26 years.</li>
          <li>He then became an eye doctor, saying he was going to study a lot so no one else passed through what he
            did.</li>
          <li>Tostão is currently one of the greatest journalists in Brazil, having wonderful texts about the game of
            football.</li>
